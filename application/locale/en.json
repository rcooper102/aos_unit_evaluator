Given that it is simulating rolls and not running statistical algorithms, the accuracy of the result increases with the number of iterations run.</p><p>When a points cost is set for each unit the simulator will automatically multiply the attacks of units so that an equal point value comparison is used for the output. If you do not wish for attacks to be normalized. Do not set points values.</p><p>Some buff fields, damage and attacks accept standard dice notation. (\"d3\",\"3\",\"2d3\", etc). All other fields do not.</p>",
